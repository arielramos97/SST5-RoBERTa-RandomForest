# SST5- Sentiment Analysis - Text Classification


The objective of this research report was to analyse and have an insight of the use of different approaches for multi-class
classification. 

The dataset (SST-5) comprises 5 classes: negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive and positive.

Two implementation approaches were proposed:

• **RoBERTa:** a transformer model that belongs to deep neural network models.

• **Random Forest classifier:** a meta estimator that fits several decision tree classifiers for improving accuracy and handling over-fitting.

For each approach, the preprocessing of the data and feature extraction will be explained as well as the architecture of the Deep Learning model for RoBERTa.
